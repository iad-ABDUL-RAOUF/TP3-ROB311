# TP3-ROB311
TP3 solved by madeleine BECKER and iad ABDUL RAOUF.

The code is to be found on the master branch. We successfully coded the QLearnningAgent and ApproxiamteQLearningAgent. It runs without errors and learns correctly on the small grid. 
For the QLearningAgent, we added a setQValue(self, state, action, value) to access the Q values more easily. 
For the ApproxiamteQAgent, we used the SimpleExtractor to determine the features used.
